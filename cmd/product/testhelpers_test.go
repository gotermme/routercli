// newTestContext - This function builds a minimal *command.AppContext
// suitable for exercising a single command handler directly, without
// needing readline, a real login session, or any of main.go's other
// startup machinery. An implementer writing their own command handler
// tests can copy this same pattern for their own handler tests.
//
// This is deliberately the same shape as cmd/core's own
// newTestContext, one independent copy per package rather than a
// shared export, since the two disagree on what State should hold,
// ProductState here, nil in package core, and package product cannot
// export a test-only helper for package core to import without pulling
// a test file into a non-test build.
//
// DaemonClient wraps the exact same *ProductState pointer State
// itself holds, daemon.NewStandaloneClient given no Levels, Users, or
// Roles of its own, empty here since a plain newTestContext, on its
// own, never reaches them through DaemonClient. Sharing the one
// pointer between State and DaemonClient's own wrapped State.ProductState
// keeps a test free to read or set State.(*ProductState) fields
// directly, the pre-migration pattern most of this package's own
// tests still use, while a handler already migrated to
// ctx.DaemonClient.MutateProductState, cmd_hostname.go's "hostname"
// for instance, observes and mutates that identical object.
//
// A test that goes on to assign a real ctx.Levels of its own, then
// replays saved configuration text through command.ReplayLines rather
// than only rendering it, can reach a Levels-mutating handler this
// package never registers itself, cmd/core's own "alias" among them,
// through this file's blank import of package core. Such a test must
// call rewireDaemonClient below after assigning ctx.Levels, the same
// way cmd/core's own tests do for the handlers this package's tests
// exercise the mirror image of; see that function's own doc comment.

// rewireDaemonClient - This function replaces ctx.DaemonClient with a
// fresh daemon.NewStandaloneClient whose own Store shares the exact
// same ctx.State, ctx.Levels, ctx.Users, and ctx.Roles a test has
// already assigned, rather than the disconnected copy newTestContext
// started out holding. See cmd/core's own identically named,
// identically documented helper in that package's own
// testhelpers_test.go for the full reasoning; this is that same
// helper, duplicated here rather than shared, for the same reason
// newTestContext itself is duplicated rather than exported: package
// product and package core stay independent siblings, neither
// importing the other.

// loadTestCommand - This function resolves handlerName into its
// *command.Command by writing a throwaway, one command tree file and
// loading it through command.LoadTree, the same loader main.go uses
// at startup. This is deliberately not a direct call into the handler
// closure itself, since command.Register stores it only in an
// unexported registry inside package command, reachable from outside
// that package through this same "run:" resolution path a real tree
// file uses. handlerName must already be registered, which every
// cmd_*.go file in this package's own init() does automatically once
// this package is imported, exactly as it is here.
